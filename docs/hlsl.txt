                                        Allowed values for convergence: -150 to 150 for each color.
red_ratio               [r,g,b]         These parameters define a 3x3 matrix which is multiplied 
grn_ratio               [r,g,b]         by the incoming RGB signal. This can be used for any
blu_ratio               [r,g,b]         standard matrix convolution, including H/S/V or simply
                                        affecting the TV-style tint.
saturation              0.0 to 4.0      This parameter defines the amount each color channel is
                                        raised above said channel's baseline grayscale value.
                                        A value of 0.0 gives a gamma-correct grayscale image,
                                        whereas 1.0 is full saturation, with each channel being
                                        oversaturated equally beyond that.
offset                  [r,g,b]         These parameters define a value for each color channel
                                        that is added to said channel after scaling and after
                                        matrix convolution. (-2.0 to 2.0)
scale                   [r,g,b]         These parameters define a value for each color channel
                                        that is multiplied with said channel after matrix
                                        convolution.  (-2.0 to 2.0)
power                   [r,g,b]         These parameters define the exponent for each color
                                        channel that is applied after scaling, offsetting,
                                        saturation and matrix convolution. (-4.0 to 4.0)
floor                   [r,g,b]         These parameters define the lower limit of each final
                                        color channel value; 0.05, for example, raises the
                                        minimum to 0.05 but re-scales to leave the max at 1.0.
phosphor_life           [r,g,b]         These parameters define the phosphor lifetime for each
                                        channel, with 0.0 representing no phosphorescence and
                                        1.0 leaving the channel on indefinitely. Values allowed
                                        range from 0.0 to 1.0.
