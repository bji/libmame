Color-Processing Parameters
---------------------------

Name                    Values		Description
red_from_r              -2.0 to 2.0     These parameters define a 3x3 matrix which is multiplied
red_from_g              -2.0 to 2.0     by the incoming RGB signal. This can be used for any
red_from_b              -2.0 to 2.0     standard matrix convolution, including H/S/V or simply
green_from_r            -2.0 to 2.0     affecting the TV-style tint.

blue_from_r             -2.0 to 2.0     
blue_from_g             -2.0 to 2.0

red_scale               -2.0 to 2.0     These parameters define a value for each color channel
green_scale             -2.0 to 2.0     that is multiplied with said channel after matrix
blue_scale              -2.0 to 2.0     convolution.
red_offset              -1.0 to 1.0     These parameters define a value for each color channel
green_offset            -1.0 to 1.0     that is added to said channel after scaling and after
blue_offset             -1.0 to 1.0     matrix convolution.
saturation               0.0 to 4.0     This parameter defines the amount each color channel is
                                        raised above said channel's baseline grayscale value.
                                        A value of 0.0 gives a gamma-correct grayscale image,
                                        whereas 1.0 is full saturation, with each channel being
                                        oversaturated equally beyond that.
red_power               -4.0 to 4.0     These parameters define the exponent for each color
green_power             -4.0 to 4.0     channel that is applied after scaling, offsetting,
blue_power              -4.0 to 4.0     saturation and matrix convolution.
red_floor                0.0 to 1.0     These parameters define the lower limit of each final
green_floor              0.0 to 1.0     color channel value; 0.05, for example, raises the
blue_floor               0.0 to 1.0     minimum to 0.05 but re-scales to leave the max at 1.0.
