This is a version of the mame osd that implements as much of the OSD as
possible using pure POSIX API calls.  POSIX is the portable operating system
interface, and should be supported on all systems.

Furthermore, this version of the OSD is intended to build a library,
libmame, *not* a standalone MAME executable (although for compatibility
with the rest of the MAME build system, a standalone executable can be
produced, it just doesn't do much).  libmame is a library that makes the
functionality of MAME available as a well-structured API with a single
external header file dependency (libmame.h).

The parts of the OSD that are not implemented directly by libmame are 
expected to be implemented by users of libmame via callbacks that are
provided to libmame.
