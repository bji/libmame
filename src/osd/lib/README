This is a version of the mame osd that turns mame into a library with a
well defined interface that can be linked from any application.

It is believed that this is a better way to segregate the core functionality
of mame (which emulates hardware) from the application (which renders the
frames of video and audio that the core mame functionality generates) than
the pre-existing system of integrating the application logic with the mame
source code itself.  It certainly makes the interface between the mame core
and the application clearer at any rate, and this should make implementing
other mame applications easier.
