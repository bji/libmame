This is a version of the mame osd that implements as much of the OSD as
possible using pure POSIX API calls.  POSIX is the portable operating system
interface, and should be supported on all systems.

The parts of the OSD which are not implementable purely in POSIX are
not implemented and expected to be implemented by the application or
library that uses this version of the OSD.
