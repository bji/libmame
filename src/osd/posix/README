This is a version of the mame osd that implements as much of the OSD as
possible using pure POSIX API calls.  POSIX is the portable operating system
interface, and should be supported on all systems.

The parts of the OSD which are not implementable purely in POSIX are
not implemented but define global pointers to functions that can be set
to provide the implementation thereof.  This is intended to be used by
libmame, which will set them to pointers to its own functions which handle
OSD functionality in a platform-specific way.
