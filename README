This is the libmame project.  It is a fork of the official MAME source code
that adds support for building a library that adheres to the libmame API.

The libmame API is well documented in a header file at src/libmame/libmame.h.

To build:

(Linux)

make BUILD_LIBMAME=1 libmame

- The resulting shared object library will be obj/posix{64}/libmame.so
- The header file is src/libmame/libmame.h
- You can build a static version of the library too:
  make BUILD_LIBMAME=1 STATIC=1 libmame
  in which case the static library will be at obj/posix{64}s/libmame.a

(Windows)

- Install MingW compiler; an extremely good choice is the compiler
  available from the Development Tools section of mamedev.org
- Ensure that you have pthreads-w64 installed; NOTE that if you installed
  the MingW compiler from mamedev.org, you will have to additionally
  extract the contents of the pthreads-w64 ZIP file and store them in
  the x64-64-w64-mingw32 folder (I am not sure why MAME ships its
  build tools with pthreads-w64 present but not unzipped, but there you
  have it).
- From a Windows CMD line, run:
  make BUILD_LIBMAME=1 libmame
- The resulting DLL will be obj/posix{64}/libmame.dll
- The header file is src/libmame/libmame.h
- You can build a static version of the library too:
  make BUILD_LIBMAME=1 STATIC=1 libmame
  in which case the static library will be at obj/posix{64}/libmame.a

(Mac OSX)

... have never built it on Mac OS X but I'm hoping it will work.  I'll
update these instructions once I know how to build on Mac OS X.
