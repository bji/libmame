This is the libmame project.  It is a fork of the official MAME source code
that adds support for building a library that adheres to the libmame API.

The libmame API is well documented in a header file at src/libmame/libmame.h.

To build:

(Linux)

make BUILD_LIBMAME=1 libmame

(Windows)

... haven't built it in a while, I'll update this when I have verified
that it still works and have instructions.

(Mac OSX)

... have never built it on Mac OS X but I'm hoping it will work.  I'll
update these instructions once I know how to build on Mac OS X.
