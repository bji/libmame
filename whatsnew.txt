Source Changes
--------------
- Considerably improved UART communications in the CD-i 68070
implementation, increasing Quizard stability as a result. [Harmony]

Fixed use of the sign bits on the SegaCD Roz parameters, improves 
the SegaCD intro rotations etc. which now appear correct. Clamp Roz 
stuff to 24-bit, seems to fix the remaining issues with the Sega 
logos. [David Haywood]

Moved -effect implementation out of OSD code and into core since the
implementations were identical across Windows/SDL and implemented in
the core itself. [Aaron Giles]

More Clang fixes (verified OK with GCC) [Balrog]

Correctly free textures when screen size dynamically changes. Fixes
texture assert when exiting on a number of games. [Aaron Giles]

Attempt to provide a correct M50458 char rom, used by the Nintendo
Super System [Pat Dardenko, Angelo Salese]

Re-worked Quizard MCU communications handling to be more easily
expanded. [Harmony]

allocated. [Aaron Giles]

Fix texture leak in crsshair.c. [Aaron Giles]

Added new method reset_origin() to screen devices to allow
manual synchronization of VBLANK start against an external timing
source. Updated the MC6845 device to call reset_origin() on its screen
at the start of each frame if a screen is present. [Aaron Giles]

Converted the RCA CDP1802 CPU into a C++ device. Refactored cidelsa.c
to use the new RCA COSMAC CPU. [Curt Coder]

Added new devcb type DEVCB_TYPE_DRIVER, which implies the
driver_device. [Aaron Giles]

Added new macros DEVCB_DRIVER_LINE_MEMBER and DEVCB_DRIVER_MEMBER to
specify member functions of the driver device in callbacks.
[Aaron Giles]

Reworked NMK16 irqs by not using cpu_getiloops() function
[Angelo Salese]

Fix custom mapping for dsp56k internal memory. [Aaron Giles]

Refactored the CDP1869 chip into a C++ device. [Curt Coder]

Added explicit control handler for the console. Ctrl+C/Ctrl+Break now
explicitly terminate the process forcefully, rather than unwinding
through the system in an unexpected state. Other console events (exit,
shutdown, logoff) request a graceful exit. [Aaron Giles]

Reworked 1942 interrupts by not using cpu_getiloops() function
[Angelo Salese]

Removed deprecat.h usage from 1943 driver [Angelo Salese]

Removed deprecat.h usage from 40love driver [Angelo Salese]

[Curt Coder]

raiden2: checkpoint current state [Olivier Galibert]

Removed IRQ hack in Niyanpai HW [Angelo Salese]

Ported over CD-i cleanup from MESS. [Harmony]

Put the SH2 DMA on a timer.  This is needed because Knuckles Chaotix
on the 32X can't be done with 'Instant DMA' due the SH2 DMA is used to
read from a FIFO port which is being filled by the 68k during the
transfer.  [David Haywood]

Fixed 8-bit dram (framebuffer) access for 32x [David Haywood]

Added sprite buffering to Mirage Youjuu Mahjongden, confirmed by a
real PCB video [Angelo Salese]

680x0: '030 MMU now emulates translation cache; fixed misinterpreted

Fixed unaligned 16 and 32-bit i/o accesses in i386 CPU core
[Barry Rodewald]

Fix bug where multiple sampleof attributes could be output, resulting
in invalid XML. [Aaron Giles]

Enable wavwrite (and aviwrite) sound even if -nosound is specified.
[Aaron Giles]

Since PNG writing is used for MNG as well, switch back to default
compression instead of best compression in order to keep the
performance reasonable. [Aaron Giles]

Fix another Clang issue [Balrog]

SH2DRC: Fix BSRF and JSR so delay slot insns can trash the calculated
PR if they want [R. Belmont]

v9938 - Set default value for status register 4 and 6  [Michael Zapf]

to boot. [Harmony]

Naomi: added protection key for gundmct, it boots now [Cah4e3]

Changed visible area and resolution of CD-i based arcade games.
[Harmony] 

New driver for Advanced Video Technology (AVT) platform
[Roberto Fresca]

 * Hooked the AY-3-8910.
 * Added games notes.
 * Added technical notes.

Patched out the majority of the Quizard 1.7 protection check and
emulated the game's inputs. [Harmony]

Patched out the majority of the Quizard 1.2 protection check and
made the patch more generic. [Harmony]

Added incomplete protection patches to Quizard 3.2 and Quizard Rainbow
4.1; both now run through attract mode and coin up, but crash when
going in-game. [Harmony]

video/neogeo.c: Call optimize_sprite_data() at VIDEO_RESET (for the
convenience of Neo Geo CD) [Barry Rodewald]

Attempt to untie the shared mapping for all games in zr107.c (midnrun,
windheat, waveshrk).  Buttons now have labels and match up to test
mode, even if you cannot play the games.  [Tafoid]

Fixed vspinbalj (vsnes.c) flipper control and eliminated duplicated
inputs. [Tafoid]

Converted render.c objects into C++ objects. Updated all callers.
[Aaron Giles]

Improvements to Subsino driver. [Roberto Fresca]
 * Created proper inputs for all Victor 6 sets.
 * Fixed/extended Magic Train technical notes.
 * Eliminated the 3 undumped bipolar PROMs from Magic Train since
    these are in fact Darlington Arrays instead of bipolar PROMs.

Replaced the excessively large Quizard patch scheme with a much
smaller 4-byte patch plus basic protection obfuscation simulation.
[Harmony]

Found the appropriate patch values for Quizard 2.2 and promoted it
to working. [Harmony]

Removed RAM protection patches from Quizard games.  All games now at
least boot with simulated protection, and the ones that were playable
before remain playable. [Harmony]

Changes LIVES to use only a single DIP instead of being split up
between two input ports by using a CUSTOM_INPUT. 
[Tafoid, Fabio Priuli]

Eliminated non-functioning service mode mapping which was a duplicate
(ssridersb - tmnt.c).  Added new labels to bombkick (yunsun16.c) to
better describe the status required for each DIP, rather than the
duplicate label "DON"T CHANGE IT!". [Tafoid]

8237dma.c: Initialize the command register to 0 on reset. 
[Wilbert Pol]

Update psx drivers to use a driver_device. [Atari Ace]

Update driver-specific sound devices to use tokens and store their
state like other devices. [Atari Ace]

Source Changes
--------------
mc6845.c: Rewritten to allow mid frame changes to the counter
registers. This enables drivers to use advanced split screen and
scrolling effects using a regular mc6845. [Wilbert Pol]

Changed the MACHINE_DRIVER_* macros, as follows: [Aaron Giles]

  1. Renamed MACHINE_DRIVER_* to MACHINE_CONFIG_* to match the name of
  the object it actually describes. The MDRV_* prefix may eventually be
  bulk updated at some point, but not now.

  2. MACHINE_CONFIG_START() now takes a driver_data_t-derived class as a
  required second parameter. This means that MDRV_DRIVER_DATA() is no
  longer required, and every "root" machine config *must* specify a
  driver data class (or driver_data_t itself if the driver has not yet
  been updated to use driver data).

  3. New MACHINE_CONFIG_DERIVED() macro defines a machine_config that is
  derived from another machine_config. This takes the place of the very
  typical MACHINE_DRIVER_START()/MDRV_IMPORT_FROM() combination.

  4. New MACHINE_CONFIG_FRAGMENT() macro defines a partial
  machine_config that can only be included in another "root"
  machine_config. This is also used for machine_configs that are
  specified as part of a device.

  5. Changed MDRV_IMPORT_FROM() to MDRV_FRAGMENT_ADD() to more
  accurately describe what is happening.

  6. Added asserts to the above three macros to ensure they are properly
  used.

Updated all machine drivers to use the new macros. Search & replace
lists below cover 99% of the changes, with just a few manual fixups.
[Aaron Giles]

timer.c: timers get rescheduled only if enable state has changed
[Christophe Jaillet]

bfm_dm01 improvements: replaced the video screen hack used for the
dotmatrix display with a more accurate, artwork-based version. The
BFM_DM01 clocks data in one byte at a time, and the new dotmatrix
render object represents the 8 dots powered by each byte. [AGEMAME]

aristmk4.c:
 * Cashcade workaround for topgear [Frasher]
 * Improved a few memory handlers [Palindrome]

Changed driver_data objects to be devices. Replaced the driver_data_t
class with a new driver_device class, which is the base class for all
driver_data objects now. The new driver devices are added as the first
device in the device list, with a tag of "root"; all other devices are
now owned by the driver device. [Aaron Giles]

Moved core callbacks (machine_start/_reset, sound_start/_reset,
video_start/_reset/_eof/_update, and palette_init) into device
configuration parameters on these new devices. The driver_device base
class overrides device_start(), ensures all other devices have been
started, and then calls, in order, the following overridable methods:

  1. DRIVER_INIT function from the game driver 
  2. palette_init() - by default calls the MDRV_PALETTE_INIT 
     function 
  3. driver_start() - new
  4. machine_start() - by default calls the MDRV_MACHINE_START function
  5. sound_start() - by default calls the MDRV_SOUND_START function
  6. video_start() - by default calls the MDRV_VIDEO_START function

Similarly, the driver_device class overrides device_reset() and then
calls these methods in order:

  driver_reset() - new 
  machine_reset() - by default calls the MDRV_MACHINE_RESET function 
  sound_reset() - by default calls the MDRV_SOUND_RESET function 
  video_reset() - by default calls the MDRV_VIDEO_RESET function

To accommodate these changes, initialization order is slightly altered
from before. The tilemap, video, sound, and debug systems are now
initialized prior to the devices' start. And the user callbacks for
DRIVER_INIT, PALETTE_INIT, MACHINE_START, SOUND_START, and VIDEO_START
are all called back-to-back. The net effect should be similar,
however. [Aaron Giles]

Changed device_t::subtag to only prepend a prefix if the device is not
the 'root' device, in order to keep compatibility with existing tag
searching. [Aaron Giles]

Changed device startup to actively reorder devices when they report
missing dependencies. This ensures that the reset functions get called
in the same order that the start functions did. [Aaron Giles]

Remove artificial SOUND_ prefix from sound device names. [Atari Ace]

Converted sauro, scotrsht, segald, seicross, senjyo, shangha3,
shaolins, shisen, skyraid, solomon, spcforce, speekatk, splash,
sprcros2, ssozumo, suna16, suna8 to driver_data. [Atari Ace]

Added include files for all remaining drivers with multiple source
files. [Atari Ace]

Changed driver_device to expose the game_driver's ROMs through the
device interface. This means all ROMs are now exposed via devices, and
thus the process of enumerating ROMs gets simpler. [Aaron Giles]

Changed all instances of temporarily allocating machine_config objects
to just put them on the stack for simplicity, letting the destructor
handle the cleanup work automatically. [Aaron Giles]

Changed machine_config constructor to take a game_driver, from which
the machine_config constructor is obtained. This also means the
resulting machine_config holds a reference to the game_driver.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed running_machine constructor to no longer take a game_driver,
since the game_driver is now obtainable via the machine_config.
[Aaron Giles]

Added two new template classes optional_device<> and
required_device<>. Use these to declare the device pointers in the
class. The only difference between the two is that required will
fatalerror if the device is not found. These new classes are "pass-
through" so the underlying pointer can be passed anywhere a regular
device pointer would work. [Aaron Giles]

Fix compiling on older GCCs (including OS X PowerPC) [Aaron Giles]

Change shared memory regions to track their size. Added
memory_get_shared() functions to retrieve a pointer to a shared region
and optionally the size. [Aaron Giles]

pipeline (pipeline.c) [stephh] :
 * Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs (after verification of the Z80 code)

Added templates required_shared_ptr<> and optional_shared_ptr<> which
work just like required_device<> and optional_device<> for retrieving
a pointer by tag from an address space that specifies AM_SHARE("tag").
Also added templates required_shared_size<> and optional_shared_size<>
for retrieving the size of the AM_SHARE region. [Aaron Giles]

Created a new generic NVRAM device. It can be configured to default to
0-fill, 1-fill, random-fill, or custom fill. In all cases, a
same-named memory region overrides the default fill. The address range
where the NVRAM can be found is now identified by an AM_SHARE() region
of the same tag as the NVRAM device. Drivers can also explicitly
configure a separately-allocated NVRAM region via
nvram_device::set_base(). [Aaron Giles]

Replaced all instances of MDRV_NVRAM_HANDLER(generic_*) with
MDRV_NVRAM_ADD_*("nvram"). Replaced all
AM_BASE_GENERIC/AM_SIZE_GENERIC(nvram) with AM_SHARE("nvram"). For all
remaining drivers that referenced the generic.nvram directly, changed
them to hold a required_shared_ptr<UINTx> to the NVRAM in their driver
state, and use that instead. Removed nvram and nvram_size from the
generic_ptrs. [Aaron Giles]

Have each device create its own device_debug instead of letting the
debugger do it. This allows the device to start itself up before the
debugger tries to figure out what to do with it. Fixes the problem
where register names were not populated into the symbol table
correctly after I shuffled the initialization order. [Aaron Giles]

multfish.c: Updated driver with new information and several new sets
as well as several new bootlegs. [MetalliC]

New driver for Jubilee's Double-Up Poker. Decoded graphics and colors
properly. Hooked the correct TMS9980 CPU, added a preliminary memory
map and some technical notes. [Roberto Fresca]

Integrated comments into debugcpu.c, and removed debugcmt.c.
Modernized the code and updated so it actually works with the modern
debug classes. [Aaron Giles]

Added AM_DEVREAD_MODERN/AM_DEVWRITE_MODERN/etc. macros for the
non-modern address map case so that updated devices can shed their
old-style read/write handlers in favor of member functions.
[Aaron Giles]

Bulk converted all okim6295_r/okim6295_w references in the address
maps to call to the modern member functions. [Aaron Giles]

quizpani (quizpani.c) [stephh] :
 * Improved Dip Switches and fixed Inputs (after verification of the
    M68000 code)

Renamed namcops2 DVDs to match labels [Guru]

Added read_status() and write_command() methods to the okim6295_device
for the common case where these are done outside the context of a read
or write handler (it was annoying to pass in the fake address space
for these cases). [Aaron Giles]

Added DEVCB_DEVICE_MEMBER() macros which allow you to specify a
READ8_MEMBER or WRITE8_MEMBER in a device callback (via dynamically
generated trampolines). [Aaron Giles]

Replaced all remaining calls to okim6295_r/okim6295_w with calls to
the new methods, and removed the static functions. [Aaron Giles]

namcops2: added dongle dump for Federation vs. Z.A.F.T. [Guru]

Fixed sprite OV flag behaviour in PC Engine VDC emulation
[Angelo Salese, Charles MacDonald]

Corrected or clarified a number of duplicated inputs for drivers up
through G  [Tafoid]

Converted ASAP CPU core from a legacy CPU core to a modern device.
[Aaron Giles]

Renamed device_execute_interface::m_icount to m_icountptr to avoid
commonly-named device values of m_icount. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed a bogus Hu6280 CPU core bug with timer latch division values
readings [Angelo Salese]

[SSV] implemented visible area registers; now the resolution for all
the games is the max visible area (the values of the registers after
the boot process) [Robert Zandona']

Fixed missing VRAM > VRAM DMA flag clearance in PC Engine emulation
[Angelo Salese]

strnskil.c: Added MCU dump for banbam. [Pete Ogoun, Andrew Gardner]

Moved sound routing for non-speaker devices over to the sound
interface's post-start method. Routing from one sound device to
another was broken when sound_init() was moved ahead of device
startup. [Aaron Giles]

Removed vestigial NVRAM from starwars, which is now covered by the
x2212 device. [Aaron Giles]

CHDMAN: rewrote bin/cue support from specs, more images now work.
[R. Belmont]

Removed generic.videoram and generic.videoram_size. These generics
have no core use, they are simply there for the convenience of
drivers. Now that drivers are required to have devices, the data
should move there. [Atari Ace]

Added proper handling of the SRAM in Aristocrat MK-5 [Palindrome]

Removed usage of I2C in Aristocrat MK-5 [Angelo Salese]

Added -bench <emulated-seconds> option to standardize benchmarking.
[Aaron Giles]

Added DECLARE/DEFINE_TRIVIAL_DERIVED_DEVICE macros to simplify the
definition of devices that are based off of a parent device, but which
differ in name and a single parameter. [Aaron Giles]

Convert ADSP21xx core to a modern CPU device. [Aaron Giles]

On Windows, osd_break_into_debugger() will now dump a stack crawl if
there's no debugger attached. This means that asserts should have a
full crawl now, for easier debugging. [Aaron Giles]

Replaced NVRAM_HANDLER in leland with an NVRAM device. [Aaron Giles]

ssv:
 * implemented y tilemap offset register; (Roberto Zandona')
 * implemented x and y visible area register; (Roberto Zandona')
 * disabled tilemap draw when mode=0; (Roberto Zandona')
 * confirmed visible area register with a twin eagle II PCB (Corrado
Tomaselli)

Replaced largely redundant NVRAM handlers with NVRAM devices for
namcos2 and a bunch of the Nichibutsu mahjong games. Also did it for
the Atari games, moving the old hard-coded EEPROM data out into files
finally. [Aaron Giles]

Merged ssgbl.c into megadrvb.c and moved bootleg input definitions out
of megadriv.c [Sonikos]

Made the mc146818 a proper device, modernized it, and added an NVRAM
interface so that drivers don't have to ask it to be manually saved.
[Aaron Giles]

Added definitions for [DECLARE_]READ_LINE_MEMBER and
[DECLARE_]WRITE_LINE_MEMBER so that read/write line callbacks can be
defined as member functions. [Aaron Giles]

Added stubs and new macro DEVCB_DEVICE_LINE_MEMBER to allow these to
be referenced from device callbacks. [Aaron Giles]

Modernized the 6522 VIA device: [Aaron Giles]
 * changed to use the new device timer mechanism
 * removed all trampolines in favor of modern methods

ssv: removed kludge for sprite x offset and implemented 1 bit of 7a-7b
register [Roberto Zandona']

ssv:
 * implemented y sprite inversion CRT register;
 * added a kludge for dynagear
 * used CRT registers to get the sprite x offset [Roberto Zandona']

ssv: removed offset values from the init; the offset now are handled
by the CRT registers [Roberto Zandona']

ssv: fixed bit #a of 7a-7b CRT register [Roberto Zandona']

Converted intelfsh to a device, updated all users. [Aaron Giles]

ssv: fixed background disable condition [Roberto Zandona']

New build tool makedep.c, derived from src2html.c (really!). Does
basic dependency analysis and supports excluding paths. [Aaron Giles]

Makefile now supports a depend target which will run makedep on the
src/$(TARGET) tree and create dependencies. It deliberately excludes
the root of src/emu as well as the osd directories in order to keep
the dependency file down to a reasonable size, so if a core header
file changes, you still need to clean and build all. [Aaron Giles]

CHDMAN: improved -extractcd bin/cue output, improved error handling.
[R. Belmont]

Added memory interface to the intelfsh device so you can access/view
the data in the debugger and via the standard memory interfaces.
Removed the old memory() method in favor of new functions
read_raw()/write_raw() which do direct reads/writes of the data.
[Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up CPS3 No-CD sets to break up the "ROMs" into individual
flash pieces which are automatically loaded by the intelfsh device on
initialization. Also split the MACHINE_CONFIG to only populate the
number of SIMMs actually present for each game, as documented in the
top of the file. And replaced the NVRAM_HANDLER with an NVRAM device.
[Aaron Giles]

CHDMAN: support for .WAV tracks in bin/cue images [R. Belmont]

neogeo.c: misc updates [Johnboy]
 * viewpoint - Renamed v's to correct chip label
 * ghostlop - Renamed roms to match proto naming sheme
 * savagere, kizuna - Added correct c1
 * crsword - Tagged MVS AND AES VERSION, added correct m1
 * legendos - Added correct m1

Triple Punch/Knock Out AY-3-8910 clock speed was incorrect, fixed and
verified from real hardware. [plgDavid] Verified clocks and oki pin on
quiz channel question boardset. [plgDavid]

Added an integral device_timer_id to device timers. This is a cleaner
way to differentiate between multiple timers rather than relying on
the pointers. These values are also saved with the timers. Updated the
few devices using device timers to leverage this. [Aaron Giles]

Added new function device_timer_call_after_resynch() which creates a
temporary 0-length timer that calls back through the device's
device_timer() method with a given device_timer_id. [Aaron Giles]

Added a function to change the MSM5205 frequency dynamically
[Angelo Salese]

Added a set volume function for CD-DA [Angelo Salese]

Converted address_space to a class, and moved most members behind
accessor methods, apart from space->machine and space->cpu. Removed
external references to 8le/8be/16le/16be/32le/32be/64le/64be. All
external access is now done via virtual functions
read_byte()/read_word()/etc. Moved differentiation between the
endianness and the bus width internal to memory.c, and also added a
new axis to support small/large address spaces, which allows for
faster lookups on spaces smaller than 18 bits. [Aaron Giles]

Provided methods for most global memory operations within the new
address_space class. Updated callers to use these instead of the
old global functions. [Aaron Giles]

Created new module delegate.h which implements C++ delegates in a form
that works for MAME. Details are in the opening comment. Delegates
allow member functions of certain classes to be used as callbacks,
which will hopefully be the beginning of the end of fetching the
driver_data field in most callbacks. All classes that host delegates
must derive from bindable_object. Today, all devices and driver_data
do implicitly via their base class. [Aaron Giles]

Added an alternate set of address map macros. Now, if you #define
ADDRESS_MAP_MODERN prior to #including "emu.h", you will get the new
macros, which have the following properties: [Aaron Giles]
 * ADDRESS_MAP_START takes a 4th parameter, which is the name of the
    driver_data class the other macros will reference
 * AM_READ/AM_WRITE/etc. all assume you are providing method names off
    of the driver_data class you originally specified
 * AM_READ_LEGACY/AM_WRITE_LEGACY macros are provided for calling
    global static functions of yore
 * AM_BASE/AM_SIZE all assume you are providing member names off of
    the driver_Data class
 * AM_BASE_LEGACY/AM_SIZE_LEGACY are provided to reference globals if
    necessary

Defined delegates for read/write handlers. The new delegates are
always passed an address_space reference, along with offset, data, and
mask. Delegates can refer to methods either in the driver_data class
or in a device class. To specify a delegate in an address map, you
must #define ADDRESS_MAP_MODERN before including emu.h, at which
point the AM_READ/AM_WRITE macros will require member function pointers
into your driver_data class. Delegates that are specified in an address 
map are proto-delegates which have no object; they are bound to their 
object when the corresponding address_space is created. [Aaron Giles]

Added machine->m_nonspecific_space which can be passed as the required
address_space parameter to the new read/write methods in legacy
situations where the space is not provided. Eventually this can go
away but we will need it for a while yet. [Aaron Giles]

Added methods to the new address_space class to dynamically install
delegates just like you can dynamically install handlers today.
Delegates installed this way must be pre-bound to their object.
[Aaron Giles]

Moved beathead's read/write handlers into members of beathead_state as
an example of using the new delegates. This provides examples of both
static (via an address_map) and dynamic (via install_handler calls)
mapping using delegates. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the DIRECT_UPDATE_CALLBACKs into delegates as well. Updated
all users to the new function format. Added methods on
direct_read_data for configuring the parameters in a standard way to
make the implementation clearer. Updated all users. [Aaron Giles]

Created a simple_list template container class for managing the common
singly-linked lists we use all over in the project. [Aaron Giles]

Replaced "const address_space" with "address_space" throughout the
system. The purpose of making it const before was to discourage direct
tampering, but private/protected does a better job of that anyhow,
and it is annoying now. [Aaron Giles]

neodrvr.c updates: [Johnboy]
 * Renamed the following sets: sengokh -> sengokuh, fatfursa ->
    fatfurspa, shocktra -> shocktroa kof99 -> kof99h, kof99a -> kof99
 * Removed wh2j (only diff. C-ROM arrangement; same data)
 * Added correct m1 to sengoku3
 * Corrected ROM_REGION "maincpu" for . twinspri, ghostlop, aof2,
    aof2a, fightfev, fightfeva
 * Added correct p1 ROM to irrmaze

Changed GP9001 (toaplan VDP device) to use DEVICE_SELF [David Haywood]

Added 3 Bags Full - 5VXFC790 (Victorian). Set is now parent. Replaced
the bad dumped GFX from NZ set with the new ones, since they match 4
of 6 bitplanes. [Roberto Fresca]

Improvements to calomega.c driver [Roberto Fresca]
 * Added Game 24.0 (Gaming Draw Poker, hold). The game is playable.
 * Added missing 50/60Hz output frequency selector to systems 903-905.
    However, I dunno how it looks physically (switch/jumper/bridge?)
 * Injected missing start and NMI vectors to comg080 (Arcade Black
    Jack), from an exhaustive program ROM analysis / reverse
    engineering. The game now starts ok and is triggering proper
    NMI's.
 * Inputs from the scratch for comg080 (Arcade Black Jack).
 * Added workaround to pass the vector-check protection.
 * Reworked the lamps circuitry by system-basis.
 * Updated games list and technical notes.
 * Promoted comg080 (Arcade Black Jack) to working state.
 * Added support for system 906III:
 * Accurate memory map, CRTC, and PIAs mapped.
 * Preliminary PIAs support (no multiplexion yet).
 * Added proper machine driver, with correct R65C02 CPU.
 * Documented the hardware specs.
 * Added Game 51.08 (CEI Video Poker, Jacks or Better), running in CEI
    906III hardware. The game is not working.

Various sm8500 CPU core fixes [Robbbert]

Improvements to CEI 906 III system. [Roberto Fresca]
 * Corrected docs about the 906III memory map.
 * Mapped the AY8912.
 * Added AY8912 proper interfase. Tied SW2 to AY8912 port.
 * PIA0, portA is polled constantly. Tied some debug handlers to
    understand how the input system works.
 * Added notes about the PIAs R/W.

Clear Z80 DART interrupts at constructor time. [Curt Coder]

Imported the Hitachi HCD62121 CPU core from MESS. [Curt Coder]

 * Improved Dip Switches (after verification of the M68000 code)

Expanded the Z80-DART interface to allow future implementation of
Z80-SIO features: [Curt Coder]
 * added separate clock inputs for channel B
 * added SYNC inputs/outputs for both channels

Toaplan2: Attempted to implement dual VDP mixing with the equations
provided by Quench, doesn't yet work [David Haywood]

added correct GFX roms for Gang Wars, renamed bootleg set as Euro set
(and new parent),made note about bootleg GFX roms [David Raingeard]

Documented unemulated protection in Super Champion Baseball, marked
the game with GAME_UNEMULATED_PROTECTION due of that [Angelo Salese]

segaic16.c: Treat unsupported read and write accesses to defined
devices/memory as open-bus reads or unmapped writes instead of falling
through to the memory-mapping registers [Phil Bennett]

Added mask-free versions of read_word/read_dword/read_qword to
address_space. Also added unaligned variants that can read unaligned
values. Rewrote the core handler as a template that handles all cases,
along with a simple unit test to verify that everything is correct.
[Aaron Giles]

Updated 68k, v60, i86, and nec cores to use unaligned read/ write
instead of their own stubs for handling misalinged reads. 
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed memory management of ga2 decryption. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed Toaplan2 VDP mixing in Batsugun [David Haywood]

Toaplan2: Removed tile limit hack, not needed now since VDP is mixed

 * aafb: Added missing 03-28008.u93 GFX ROM
 * aafbb: Marked 24015-02.u59 BAD_DUMP and demoted set to
    GAME_NOT_WORKING

Declared virtual functions in driver_data_t for:
 * machine_start, machine_reset
 * sound_start, sound_reset
 * palette_init, video_start, video_reset, video_update, video_eof
The default implementations of these call through the machine
configuration's functions as before. However, if a driver_data_t
overrides them, it will be called instead. [Aaron Giles]

Also added virtual functions for pre_save() and post_load(), which can
be overridden to implement machine driver-specific pre-save/post-load
functionality instead of registering with the save state system.
[Aaron Giles]

Updated beathead to use these new virtual functions instead of
specifying callbacks in the MACHINE_DRIVER. [Aaron Giles]

CPS-1 update [Team CPS-1]:
 * Added proper willowj roms to match real pcb, it was using incorrect
    roms copied from parent set
 * Added an old pcb rev of knightsj, using split roms
 * Added an old pcb rev of kodj, using split roms
 * Added newer Street Fighter II CE set

 * Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs (after verification of the Z80 code)
 * Fixed coin insertion which now correctly supports "Coin A" and
    "Coin B" settings

naomi.c: Added information about the Namco MASK B-F2X cartridge
[f205v]

Improved sound in Erotictac / Poizone [Angelo Salese, Phil Bennett]

De-converted MACHINE_DRIVER from tokens back to constructor functions,
regaining type safety. If legacy devices still use inline data, those
types are not checked. However, new devices no longer have access to
the generic m_inline_data. Instead their MDRV_* macros should map to
calls to static functions in the device config class which downcast a
generic device_config to the specific device config, and then set the
appropriate values. This is not to be done inline in order to prevent
further code bloat in the constructors. See
eeprom/7474/i2cmem/okim6295 for examples. [Aaron Giles]

Updated the i8237 DMA device to no longer be legacy. [Harmony]

Updated the 8255 PPI device to no longer be legacy. [Harmony]

lets you disassemble the "jam table" instructions used by the bios to
do some basic hardware initialization.

Updated the i8257 DMA device to no longer be legacy. [Harmony]

Updated the Dallas DS1302 RTC device to no longer be legacy. [Harmony]

pachifev (pachifev.c) [stephh] :
 * Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs (after verification of the TMS9995
    code)

Updated the Dallas DS2404 RTC device to no longer be legacy. [Harmony]

- 03969: [Crash/Freeze] All sets and drivers using OKI audio: 
         Eventual crash using Save States (Aaron Giles)
- 03981: [Crash/Freeze] bosco, xevious and clones: Game reboots or 
         hangs (Alex Jackson)
- 03977: [Graphics] tceptor2: Graphics are incorrect, the top and 
         bottom roads are displayed with grids and it looks like 
         there should be 4 instead of 2. (Phil Bennett)
- 03964: [Documentation] shangonro: Year is wrong (Smitdogg)



Source Changes
--------------
raiden2.c: Add missing "VOICE2" sample rom to Raiden 2 sets where it
was missing.  Corrected rom names for MASK roms soldered to the PCB.
[Brian Troha]

Southern Systems Joker Poker: Added missing CPU IO map to the machine
driver. This allow boot the game and enter into the attract mode.
[Roberto Fresca]

Mini Boy 7 improvements: [Roberto Fresca]
 * Added a new complete set. Now set as parent.
 * Corrected Xtal frequency.
 * Mapped the PIA MC6821 (not wired since is not totally understood).
 * Preliminary attempt to decode the color PROM.
 * Mapped the AY-3-8910, but still needs ports and some checks.
 * Added debug and technical notes.

New driver for Mega Double Poker, from Blitz System Inc.
[Roberto Fresca]
 * Initial release.
 * Preliminary memory map.
 * Hooked both PIAs, but need more analysis to confirm the offsets.
 * Accurate graphics and color decode.
 * Added main PCB and daughterboard layouts.
 * Added partial docs and diagrams about the CPU/MCU/ROMs addressing.
 * Added debug and technical notes.

Added Magic Train, from Subsino. Since it's driven by a HD647180X0CP6
(Subsino - SS9600) plus SS9601 and SS9602 (for video and I/O
respectively), it's possible that needs to be moved to a new driver in
a near future. Also added technical notes. [Roberto Fresca]

mpu4drvr.c: Fixed mid-screen palette updates [David Haywood]

segas16b.c: Documented the Sega game ID for the Heavyweight Champ rom
board as well as corrected the rom names. [Brian Troha]

Return to type safety. Changed address maps back into functions that
build up the definition, rather than the whole tokenizing system,
which lost type checking. Added a new module addrmap.c which
implements the address map classes, and changed the macros to call
methods on the address_map and address_map_entry classes which are
strongly typed. Fixed a few incorrectly specified memory map entries 
along the way in twincobr.c, lordgun.c, galaxold.c. [Aaron Giles]

More API cleanup: [Aaron Giles]
 * removed cputag_clocks_to_attotime() and cputag_attotime_to_clocks()
    in favor of just expanding the class
 * same for cputag_suspend() and cputag_resume()

Fix crash when exiting the debugger if breakpoints are set. 
[Aaron Giles]

The dsp561xx CPU core now generates accurate disassembly for Konami
Polygonet hardware (verified against Motorola's reference
disassembler). [Andrew Gardner, Stiletto]

Fixed image device error handling [ShimaPong, Miodrag Milanovic]

Defined new class driver_data_t, which all driver_data classes must
derive from. Updated all class definitions to inherit from the new
class, and to call it in the constructor. Also changed the alloc()
signature to return a driver_data_t pointer instead of a void *.
Renamed and hid machine->driver_data as machine->m_driver_data. Added
a new templatized method machine->driver_data<class> which returns a
properly downcast'ed version of the driver data. Updated all code
which looked like this:

  mydriver_state *state = (mydriver_state *)machine->driver_data;

to this:

  mydriver_state *state = machine->driver_data<mydriver_state>();

The new function does a downcast<> which in debug builds dynamically
verifies that you're actually casting to the right type. [Aaron Giles]

Changed atarigen_state to be a base class from which all the related
Atari drivers derive their state from. [Aaron Giles]

Removed global variables from gaelco, namco, and nile sound cores.
[Atari Ace]

Converted seta.c, seta2.c, and ssv.c to driver_data. [Atari Ace]

Updated SAA5050 to form 12x20 chars as noted in documentation.
Updated malzak driver to support SAA5050 changes. [Miodrag Milanovic]

taitotz: add HDD image for Battle Gear 2 (2.04J) [gtbb08, R. Belmont]

namcoic.c: Fixed incorrect road colours in tceptor2, finallap and
others [Phil Bennett]

Fixed road transparency in Thunder Ceptor [Phil Bennett]

Fixed Z80 SIO interrupts by clearing them at constructor time so Z80 
daisy chain works properly and doesn't stall on a non-existant IEO 
condition. [Curt Coder]

Z80 DMA changes: [Curt Coder]
 - Fixed DMA by re-adding a status update call to ENABLE DMA command
 - Allowed illegal mode 0 DMA operation since trs80m2 in MESS is 
    abusing this
 - Fixed ready signal handling by adding a check for ready condition 
    on each byte

Started converting the Toaplan2 VDP into a device [David Haywood]

dsp56k : Hooked up new execution engine. [Andrew Gardner]

plygonet.c : Updates Polygonet driver to use driver_data class.
[Atari Ace]

More refactoring to the Toaplan 2 / GP9001 VDP device [David Haywood]

CPS-1 update [Team CPS-1]:
 * Expanded and updated games table in video\cps1.c
 * Confirmed B-Board # for 3wondersu, varth
 * Fixed labels in ghouls, ghoulsu to match real pcbs
 * Removed 14.bin in dynwarj, it was a bad dump
 * Marked nm_23.12b in nemoj BAD_DUMP
 * Removed knightsja set (roms were split & hacked to work on a
    suicided board)
 * Added roms relationship between parent/clones where missing
 * Fixed some incorrect notes added in previous update
 * dynwaru -> dynwara forgottnua -> forgottnu, forgottnu -> forgottnua
    wofhfb -> wofhfh as real name Huo Feng Huang

dsp56k.c : Remove globals from dsp56k cpu core. [AtariAce]

cps1.c: Documentation update for some CPS1 sets (B-Board chip
information) verified via Team Japump PCB photos. [Brian Troha]

Improved memory banking in Puzzle Star (Sang Ho Soft)
[Mariusz Wojcieszek]

Fixed term2 (rev. LA4) freeze during the Cyberdyne stage opening
cinematic [Phil Bennett]

Merged aladbl.c and ssf2md.c to create genesisb.c [Sonikos]

video/astrocde.c: Limited the number of timers potentially produced by
astrocade_trigger_lightpen() [ranger_lennier]

cps1.c: Set correct B-Board mapper for "resale" kits.  This fixes
missing graphics in Area 88 (Japan Resale). [Brian Troha]
