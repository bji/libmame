# To build mame as a library, use:
# OSD=lib ./batcab-make libmame

# You may also want to do:
# OST=lib SUBTARGET=tiny ./batcab-make libmame
# The above will build a much smaller version of libmame with many fewer
# romsets supported but builds *alot* faster, which makes it good for testing

# MAME makefiles are DUMB and have dependencies on a phony maketree target
# that causes lots of targets to be rebuilt unnecessarily all of the time.
# For libmame, maketree is not depended on in this way, so that needless
# rebuilds don't happen all of the time; but since the maketree target must
# be built, it's done here every time
